# This repo is very much WIP and not organized at all.

I am still a NixOS noob, and this is my attempt at configuring my system. This repo will be cleaned up in the future, but currently it is just used as a config dump. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, as I do not guarantee that any of this works.

`sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#system`

`home-manager switch`
